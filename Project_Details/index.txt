Project Definition :

* Create a file vendor.js that contains all the DOM related definitions.
* Also, create an app.js file that contains the logic.
* Inside app.js, create event Handler functions like 'attackHandler' and 'strongAttackHandler' 
to handle button clicks on 'ATTACK' and 'STRONG ATTACK' respectively.
* Upon every click, the damage to monster and player affects the health of 
the monster and player, whichever health reaches 0(zero) first wins, otherwise it's a draw.
* Create a monsterAttack function that defines the logic for ATTACK and 
STRONG ATTACK, that depend's upon the attack handlers.
* Create a healPlayerHandler function that heals the player based on certain condition like if 
currentPlayerHealth <= chosenMaxLife - HEAL_VALUE;, also the player take an 
attack from the monster after every heal. And we finally increase the 
player's health by calling increasePlayerHealth(healValue) function and 
* Write the logic for conditional bonus life inside endRound() function 
using if statement that calls for a bonus life only if the variable hasBonusLife 
is true, in this scenario the currentPlayerHealth becomes stagnant when the bonus 
life is used and also the #bonus-life element gets removed from the DOM!
* Add reset game functionality using reset() and resetGame() functions. 
Defined a reset() and calls the resetGame(userInput) inside it that updates the 
monster health and player health based upon user input.
